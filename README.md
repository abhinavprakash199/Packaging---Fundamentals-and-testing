# Packaging---Fundamentals-and-testing

This repository contains the whole summary of the hands-on work done by Abhinav Prakash (IS22MTECH14002) during the workshop on RISC-V-based MYTH, understanding and coding the piplened RISC-V micro-architecture using TL-Verilog. Understand in detail about machine code, the different ISA of RISC-V, the Instruction Fretch to Write Back process, and coding the optimized architecture. of RICS-V.
